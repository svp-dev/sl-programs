============

This directory contains an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in
SVP. 

Acknowledgements
----------------

The initial implementation was provided by Thorben Krueger, Marten
Lohstroh, and Vasco Visser, MSc students at the University of
Amsterdam following the Concurrent Systems course in 2010. 

This implementation uses the C hash table code from Christopher Clark
(christopher.clark-at-cl.cam.ac.uk,
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cwc22/hashtable/), available under the terms
of the BSD license.

The entire source tree was then integrated to the SL benchmark suite
by Q. Yang.
